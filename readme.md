## Why?
Recalling the magic of a classic Japanese puzzle box from my childhood, I wanted to try some physical puzzle boxes and ended up watching several being unlocked on YouTube.

To save money, I thought I'd replicate the basic mechanics of a puzzle box, virtually.

To keep myself interested, the puzzles needed to be procedurally genated.

### Why the name?
Since modern puzzle boxes are created by humans who craft stories and design puzzles with care, a virtual random puzzle box felt a bit soulless. Hence the name - a [cow](https://creativeobjectworld.com/cow)-inspired variation on Mukon.

## How?
To build it I maxed-out several free-tier AI coding agents and spent most of my time correcting their homework over and over again.

Since I didnt want to get into the whole 3D side of things where users rotate in 3D space a virtual box, I present one side of the box as a panel, solve that and you can move on to the next. Unlocked elements can (and sometimes must) be used on later panels to unlock the whole virtual box (that probably won't have 6 sides).

## Aims?
- Mobile first
- Web UI
- No introduction
- No words or numbers
- No hints, just sort it out yourself if you can be bothered.

## Plans?
- I'd like to keep pushing AI to add new techniques and new shapes so I can be puzzled as well.
