c1 1.25x1.25 5x3- 0 0 c,
w4 1x1 6x1 0 5-4-2 tap state 9 c1 reset,
p3 0.63x1.25 3x2+ 0 7 drag,
q2 0.63x1.25 1x1+ 0 0 drag 

When I drop p3 into c1 it snaps, but I cant drop and snap q2.  But if I first drop q2 it snaps and then I can drop and snap p3 ok.

There should NOT be a specific order the plugs need to be dropped into a socket.

When resetting a socket that takes two or more plugs, we need to reset the count of the plugs in the socket.
